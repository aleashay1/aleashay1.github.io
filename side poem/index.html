        <h1>Waves</h1>
        <h2>Waves</h2>
        <h3>Waves</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="wave1">
                How do I state simply,<br>
                That I am breaking trying<br>
                To feed what it is inside of you<br>
                That I wish to keep.<br>
                It was never mine to begin with.<br>
                I don't want you to leave,<br>
                Leave like everyone else has,<br>
                So I break.<br>
                I take it upon myself to<br>
                Board the ship, setting sail to<br>
                The land of your groin,<br>
                Weary and exhausted.
            </p>
            <p class="wave2">
                I man the ship, all parts,<br>
                To all ports.<br>
                It is not that I don't love being captain,<br>
                It is that I am manning it alone.<br>
                I pull the strings,<br>
                To make you feel the wind,<br>
                Let the blazen wisps of desire<br>
                Strike you like the back of a hand<br>
                To the face,<br>
                Steer the wheel to the left<br>
                To cultivate the waves<br>
                That make you weak and<br>
                Wanting more,<br>
                And steer right to<br>
                Show you the wave is something even I, too, can coast.<br>
                I stand on the lookout post,<br>
                Seeking more waves to drift into<br>
                Whenever the opportunity appears,<br>
                To show you that you are wanted<br>
                Even when I am exhausted.<br>
                To show you I am always here,<br>
                Trying to ride the ship <br>
                However long you wish. <br>
                I desperately run end to end,<br>
                Bow to stern, <br>
                Making ends meet,<br>
                Just to please you.<br>
                In that ship,
            </p>
            <p class="wave3">
                There is all the room to run<br>
                Aimlessly, twirl around and dance,<br>
                Yet I have no energy to <br>
                Frolic about while I wait<br>
                For you to take the lead.<br>
                Wondering when you'll <br>
                Notice all the work I've done.<br>
                The only dancing is the sacred escapade <br>
                Of dodging the holes in the floor,<br>
                So I don't fall into the bottom,<br>
                Hit the floor of fear,<br>
                And deteriorate in the darkness<br>
                That this ship will just not do it for you,<br>
                And that I can not trust that <br>
                When the time comes, and the decision<br>
                Is laid in front of you, that you will board the ship,<br>
                Not stay on port.<br>
                Rather than wait for that time to come,<br>
                I reign the ship widely through <br>
                The stormy waters,<br>
                Waiting for you to take the strings,<br>
                So I can feel the wisps,<br>
                To let the flag fly so<br>
                I can feel the caressing.<br>
                I have apparently left no room in an empty ship<br>
                For you to show me<br>
                The rails, <br>
                While I'm barely grasping the mast.<br>
                The ship is empty.<br>
                You are nowhere to be found.<br>
                And all I wanted was for you<br>
                To show up and sail me.
