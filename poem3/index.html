                And I think it is normal,<br>
                I think it is normal that<br>
                On first experiences<br>
                We have doubt.<br>
                I don't think we are<br>
                Supposed to be perfectly made,<br>
                Solidified with clay,<br>
                Molded to glassy perfection<br>
                In the kiln and set out<br>
                For display on the<br>
                First attempt at something new.<br>
                Wrapped up in a tight little bubble,<br>
                The vision is clear<br>
                And the world is big,<br>
                And everything is so...

                A new experience.<br>
                The bubble has been<br>
                Burst wide open.<br>
                The world flushes in,<br>
                Drowning the insides of the bubble.<br>
                A whiplash of an experience,<br>
                Questioning the totality of<br>
                All identites the bubble is made up of,<br>
                As the new experience rapes the bubble's insides.<br>
                There is no more drifting.<br>
                No more floating,<br>
                Just falling and then...

                Splat.

            <p class="gold">
                Hitting the ground running,<br>
                The insides of the bubble<br>
                Grasps for any understanding<br>
                Of something that it knows.<br>
                It's entire world has been shattered.<br>
                It doesn't know what to do<br>
                With itself in this new terrain.<br>
                Breathless.<br>
                The uncontained insides of the bubble<br>
                Loses sight on what to do,<br>
                Other than to wave the white flag,<br>
                And surrender to the contemporary.
