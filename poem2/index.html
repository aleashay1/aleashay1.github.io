            I spent ages trying to fill my mouth<br>
            With a sweet taste I dreamt about at night.<br>
            And once I got that taste, I didn't dare take it for granted.<br>
            I let it inhabit my taste buds,<br>
            Crawl under my tongue and into the deep blue veins streaming straight to my heart.<br>
            I swished with it every time I got the chance, like I was addicted.<br>
            I let it flow into my body.<br>
            I let it overtake me.<br>
            I held onto it, and I didn't plan on letting go.<br>
            Overtime, I soon found myself doing all I could to clear my spirit of this taste.<br>
            It became foul.<br>
            It lost it's luster.<br>
            I've spent many nights trying to rid the taste from my mouth,<br>
            It making me sick and nauseous.<br>
            I never had been able to get rid of it myself.
        </p>
        <p class="mouthwash">
            A new taste has flooded my mouth.<br>
            Swarming in just like the last time,<br>
            But this one delighted me, for it was gentle.<br>
            Gentle, caressing, and it slowly slid into my taste buds,<br>
            My veins,<br>
            My being.<br>
            It tenderly and swiftly darted around, sneaky almost.<br>
            It's benevolence took me over.<br>
            I again will not take it for granted,<br>
            And make sure that this<br>
            Sugary sweet, addicting taste<br>
            Stays so flavorful, for as long<br>
            As this being walks the earth.
