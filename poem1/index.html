                Things I must endure. <br>
                Like the curdling smell of<br>
                Self pity eating away at the flesh of<br>
                The dead remnants of another hollow carcass eaten up by<br>
                Depression.<br>
                I could puke at the soiled grounds.<br>
                The dirt dances in the mush of blood from old wounds,<br>
                And me?<br>
                I can not even hear.<br>
                It is a hollow feeling,<br>
                And I am an empty shell.<br>
                I panic for someone to grab a stick and poke my lifeless body<br>
                Just to make sure I am alive.<br>
                When I said I wanted endurance, this is not what I meant.<br>
                It is like a barren land where the flies have come and gone,<br>
                But the damage is still there.<br>
                Disgusting and putrid.<br>
                Sit still.<br>
                It is one thing to sit with something that makes you squirm.<br>
                It is another when it makes you sick.<br>
                Has it been 5 minutes or 5 years?<br>
                That is the question.<br>
                One I can not even answer for myself as I dose in and out,<br>
                As I become overwhelmed by faint waifs of an unexplainable stench.<br>
                Death.<br>
                Rodents come through to make a home of nothing.<br>
                How much closer to the edge can I get before I jump?<br>
                I have choices today.<br>
                That I do.<br>
                I can choose to jump, when I can barely stand another minute<br>
                Inside the decaying shell of a person left to<br>
                Her own devices.<br>
                How many people would have to endure because I could not?<br>
                I can choose to stand and decay, with a hope that at the<br>
                End of the tunnel there is fresher air.<br>
                This tunnel has run forever, and I do not see it ending.<br>
                I want to hold on to something.<br>
                I grab a rib of the dead animal I am traveling inside.<br>
                The grip is lost in mere seconds as I take my hand back and see<br>
                Dripping blood full of self loathing.<br>
                I have not reached the end yet.<br>
                That point others talk about that if it had not been there,<br>
                Neither would they have at this very moment.<br>
                I have made it heart deep into the wastes of the intestines.<br>
                Scraping together whatever trash I find, only for the betterment<br>
                Of the living outside this trap.<br>
                And that is the only hope I have to give.<br>
                That my head is not fully under.<br>
                That there is a little more stench to breathe in.<br>
                One more second to live,<br>
                Before I make it out alive,<br>
                Or die trying.
